# Logic Test
1. Create a **base class** for "Solar System" and **derived classes** for"stars", "terrestrial planets", "gas giants", "ice giants", and "dwarf planets". Create specific classes for"Sun", "Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranos", "Neptune", "Ceres", "Pluto", "Eris", "Haumea", and "Makemake".

1. Create a collection for all 14 celestial bodies where we can retrieve its name, a picture, distance from the sun, orbital period, and mass.

1. Use Lambda Expressions to select all celestial bodies sorted by orbital period around the sun (in days) from shortest to the longest.

1. Implement an interface for all celestial bodies that "Can sustain life", "Can be terraformed" and, "Hassatellite moon(s)" and an extension method named Colonize().

## Instructions:
* There is no right or wrong answer
* A design model is enough, although code would help us to assess your skills better
  * If you choose to code, know that we are not looking for perfect syntaxes, but how you manage and organize your code
* Use the rules and data determined by the International Astronomical Union (orIAU).
* Pitfalls and omissions are embedded in this test, you have to make assumptions by yourself or ask us for help on how to handle them.
